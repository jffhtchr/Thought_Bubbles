JavaScript Motion Detection Messaging Interface

Thought_Bubbles is a real-time messaging application that allows a user to send a message via web sockets by using a JavaScript Motion Detection controlelled interface. A user can scroll left or right through a stream of characters my moving their head into "hot spots" that fire events to control the character stream component when motion is detected. When a user has selected a character, they can then join that character into their message by moving their head into the "Select" hot spot. Once a message is created, a user can select the "SEND!" option in the character stream which sends the created message to the Chat component via web sockets. 

Thought_Bubbles was created using React-Redux, JS Motion Capture, Socket.io, Node.js and Express.js.
